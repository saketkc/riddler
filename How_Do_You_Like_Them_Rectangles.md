24/4 = 6 => width of the topmost rectangle.

Width of second rectangle = 6+3
=> Width of bottom most rectangle = 6+3+2 = 11
=> Height of bottom most rectanlge = 44/11 = 4

Let's call the '?' area to be A.

Draw a small rectangle in the rectangle with are 34 of area 2. sharing an edge with rectangle of area 32. Extend this all the way to the lower rectangle.
Also complete the upper rectangle by extending it so that the top half consists of 4 rectangles with are 32, 2, 32 and A'. The bottom rectangle half consists of these rectangles: A, x, 32, 45-A-x

Now, using similar rectangles: 32/A = 2/x => x = A/16

Total area (after extending the top rectangle half) = 14 x 11

(32 + 2 + 32   + A') + (A + A/16 + 32 + 45-A-A/16) = 154

 => A+A' = 43 (1)

But similar rectangles again: 32/A = A'/(45-A-A/16)  (2)

Solving (1) and (2) gives a quadratic in A:

A^2- 77A + 32*45 = 0 

=> A = 32 or 45

But 45-17A/16 > 0 so A cannot be 45.

Hence '?' = 32
